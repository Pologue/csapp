# Notes

## phase_1

Simply compare input string and target string.

## phase_2

Is about for loop and multiply, which I didn't solved on my own actually.

## phase_3

Is about switch case, simple phase.

## phase_4

First number is between 0 and 0xe(14), second number is 0. Nesting function.

## phase_5

Input string's length is 6, each char & with 0xf to get index of:
'maduiersnfotvbylSo you think you can stop the bomb with ctrl-c, do you?'

Then compare with:
'flyers'

So index should be: 9 15 14 5 6 7
Corresponding char: 9 /  .  5 6 7
